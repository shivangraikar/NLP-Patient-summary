# NLP-Patient-summary

Natural language processing used for calculating a patient readmission probability.

**Patient-Summary!** helps in finding the readmission probability of a patient with short summary of text.

* Easy to Generate New Model apt to requirements.
* Adaptable colab iterface for fast computing.
* East understanding of every step.
* Latent semantic analyser for summary generation.

### ▶️ Download the dataset and python notebook
* Admissions.csv


### ▶️ Perform following steps to run the code
* Open using google colab for basic installed libraries. 
* Run each cell to get the output for next steps.
* The probability more than 0.5 indicates that the patient must be readmitted else not.
* The LSA also generates a short summary of the text field for each patient.


### Accepts patient number before calculating the results.
--------

```
Enter the patient number for which you want the readmission probability and summary of the issue: 111

The probability of readmitting patient number 111 is --> 0.5091727115353961

The summary of patient number 111 is --> The left anterior descending has 30 to 40% narrowing with tortuosity in its proximal portion, patent first septal perforator branch.
